# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Robotics

## Module Overview

This module covers Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and voice commands for advanced robot control. You will learn how to connect human language understanding with robotic action execution, creating intuitive interfaces for robot operation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Implement Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system architectures
- Integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with robotic systems
- Process voice commands using Whisper and other speech recognition tools
- Translate natural language commands into robotic actions
- Design multimodal interfaces combining vision, language, and action
- Implement task decomposition for complex robotic operations
- Create language-driven robot control systems

## Required Tools

- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill (or later)
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API access or open-source LLM (e.g., Llama)
- Speech recognition libraries (e.g., Whisper)
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Git
