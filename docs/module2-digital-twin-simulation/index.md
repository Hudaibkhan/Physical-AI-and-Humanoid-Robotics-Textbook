# Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation

## Module Overview

This module explores the creation and utilization of digital twins for robotics, focusing on physics simulation with Gazebo and high-fidelity visualization with Unity. You will learn how to create accurate virtual representations of physical robots and environments, enabling safe testing and development before deploying to real hardware.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Create realistic physics simulations using Gazebo
- Model robot-environment interactions with accurate physics
- Implement sensor simulation for cameras, LiDAR, and IMU
- Build custom worlds and environments for robot testing
- Use Unity for high-fidelity visualization and rendering
- Integrate simulation data with ROS 2 for seamless development

## Required Tools

- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill (or later)
