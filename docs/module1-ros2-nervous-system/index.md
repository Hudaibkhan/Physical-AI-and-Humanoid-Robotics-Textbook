# Module 1: ROS 2 Nervous System

## Module Overview

This module introduces the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), the middleware that acts as the nervous system of robotic systems. You will learn how ROS 2 enables different components of a robot to communicate with each other, coordinate actions, and work together as a unified system. This forms the foundation for all subsequent modules in the textbook.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 and its architecture
- Create and run ROS 2 nodes for different robot components
- Implement communication between nodes using topics, services, and actions
- Define robot structure using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Work with sensors and actuators in ROS 2
- Launch complex robot systems with launch files

## Required Tools

- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill (or later)
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or Windows with WSL2)
- Python 3.8+ or C++ compiler
- Git
- Basic development tools

## Module Structure

- Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2
- Chapter 2: Nodes and Packages
- Chapter 3: Topics and Message Passing
- Chapter 4: Services and Actions
